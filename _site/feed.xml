Pretty girls get more. My parents never gave me the attention I needed. So I decided to go and get it myself. 
  It was 2014 when I opened Facebook. At first I didn’t get a lot of friend requests because the lighting in my selfies and the angles were not correct. Also because I took my own pictures but as I now know you always have to make someone else take your pictures and get five other people to choose your profile photo for you so you tag can all of them and get more attention. I did all of that but other girls still had more friend requests than I did. And the more friend requests you have, the more important you are as a human being, we all know that.
  I tried a lot but the number of requests and followers I had was still very low. My mother told me that’s because I am not pretty and no one will ever marry me. So I decided to do what any girl would under the circumstances, I downloaded a lot of premium photo editors and made myself look beautiful and unrecognizable. Because why learn to accept what you are when you can just be someone else right? All the boys loved it. I had over 4 thousand followers in a week. I finally felt like I matter. Every guy wanted to date me and I did go on a date with them but there was never a second date with the same guy. They said I look too different. But they are just jerks because why can’t you accept me for who I really am even though I clearly cannot? Is that too much to ask?&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

But things got harder as I grew up. I almost felt embarrassed to go to school at one point. It was 6 months ago when my bestfriend Sahid bought the latest model of premio and he would drive to school with the car everyday. Me on the other hand was still driving last year’s (2016) Premio model. I couldn’t function properly knowing that my friend Shahid whom I had once considered my equal was now my superior. As anyone would in my situation, I decided to change schools. But this transition only added to my anxiety as the kids in this school were all driving 2015’s premio model. You know how kids can be, they see someone better than them and they immediately cut them off. So here I became an outcast. They wouldn’t talk to me. Maybe they expected me to be the smaller man and walk up to them to initiate a conversation, but that was not possible considering I was already the bigger man since I had the newer model of Premio. So everyday I have to suffer. Things never get any easier but hey like my grandfather always used to say, “It doesn’t matter what others think of you as long as you have the newer premio model”.&lt;/p&gt;

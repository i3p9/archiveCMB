  Being a girl you always receive more friend requests than boys do. Pretty girls get more. My parents never gave me the attention I needed. So I decided to go and get it myself. 
  It was 2014 when I opened Facebook. At first I didn't get a lot of friend requests because the lighting in my selfies and the angles were not correct. Also because I took my own pictures but as I now know you always have to make someone else take your pictures and get five other people to choose your profile photo for you so you tag can all of them and get more attention. I did all of that but other girls still had more friend requests than I did. And the more friend requests you have, the more important you are as a human being, we all know that.
  I tried a lot but the number of requests and followers I had was still very low. My mother told me that's because I am not pretty and no one will ever marry me. So I decided to do what any girl would under the circumstances, I downloaded a lot of premium photo editors and made myself look beautiful and unrecognizable. Because why learn to accept what you are when you can just be someone else right? All the boys loved it. I had over 4 thousand followers in a week. I finally felt like I matter. Every guy wanted to date me and I did go on a date with them but there was never a second date with the same guy. They said I look too different. But they are just jerks because why can't you accept me for who I really am even though I clearly cannot? Is that too much to ask?

School was always fun for me as a child. But things got harder as I grew up. I almost felt embarrassed to go to school at one point. It was 6 months ago when my bestfriend Sahid bought the latest model of premio and he would drive to school with the car everyday. Me on the other hand was still driving last year's (2016) Premio model. I couldn't function properly knowing that my friend Shahid whom I had once considered my equal was now my superior. As anyone would in my situation, I decided to change schools. But this transition only added to my anxiety as the kids in this school were all driving 2015's premio model. You know how kids can be, they see someone better than them and they immediately cut them off. So here I became an outcast. They wouldn't talk to me. Maybe they expected me to be the smaller man and walk up to them to initiate a conversation, but that was not possible considering I was already the bigger man since I had the newer model of Premio. So everyday I have to suffer. Things never get any easier but hey like my grandfather always used to say, "It doesn't matter what others think of you as long as you have the newer premio model".
